# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Because this repository follows a linear development strategy, security fixes will be appended to the master branch, and a security release will be made, allowing you to install the latest version every time a security hole is patched.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This section outlines how to safely report a vulnerability.

To report a vulnerability, send an email to [cppcgilibsecurity@googlegroups.com](mailto:cppcgilibsecurity@googlegroups.com). Be sure to be as clear and descriptive as you can, and include some way of contacting you back. You can expect to recieve security updates as quickly as they are disclosed, as we take security very seriously (CGI scripts are very easy to attack when done wrong). To be sure, though, announcements will not be made until a security advisory is released, which is when a security release has been made.

If your report is accepted, you can expect a response via your identification that you gave, and a link to a private repository fork that you have been invited to, so that we can work on it.

If your report is declined, however, we will respond as such, and remind you that we're always looking for more contributors, so it is always appreciated if you so much as pitch in on an issue. A report can be declined if it has already been patched, if the threat doesn't really exist, or you gave insufficient identification. If you don't receive a response within a single business day, assume that the identification you gave was insufficient.
