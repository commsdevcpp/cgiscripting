## About The Project

[![CGI Scripting Code](images/product-screenshot.png)](https://commsdevcpp.github.io/cgiscripting)

Dynamic content is the one concept that allows so much of the modern web to exist. For example, you wouldn't have access to online accounts, because so many services return different content from what you request if you're not logged in. Online banking, Google, Microsoft, Reddit, Twitter, GitHub, and more all take advantage of the ability to generate dynamic content.

"How do they do it?" you might ask yourself. The answer is simple. *Server-side Scripting*. This is a term that makes many programmers feel uneasy, due to the existance of languages like PHP. Regardless, a server-side script is a file on a server that, instead of being sent out as the content itself, gets run, and the output of the program is what gets sent. The problem, of course, comes with how to communicate with the server to get some important information? How do you get a cookie that the client sent without making your own server and starting from scratch (we ***really*** don't recommend this)? To answer this question, the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) published a request for comments (specification) document on a new concept they had been working on, called the Common Gateway Interface.

Obviously, we won't go into detail with what they spec says (read it [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875)), but the simple answer is that the server can start up a program with a special environment called the interface. The server sets up an environment for the program to work in, setting environment variables, and redirecting `stdin` and `stdout` to the necessary locations. The problem is that the fundamentals of the POSIX environment were never meant to carry such information as twelve cookies in one variable, so there are some problems.

To make a long story short, getting all of the information required from this interface is tedious and requires quite a bit of barebones code, which, let's be honest, nobody likes writing. To solve this issue, and offer more functionality without cluttering up your scripts, we've written a C++ library to do this all for you! You can get headers, read metadata about the request, send files, and more!

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This library requires that you have the following, or some good replacement for the following.

* Linux (tested on Ubuntu Bionic and Debian)
* C++ version 17
* g++ version 8.3.0
* A CGI compliant webserver capable of running executable files

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Move the header file into `/usr/local/include`
3. Clean up
4. Done! Reference the library like this: `#include <cgilib.h>`

```
# git clone https://github.com/commsdevcpp/cgiscripting.git tmp/cgiscripting
# mv tmp/cgiscripting/cgilib.h /usr/local/include/cgilib.h
# rm -r tmp/cgiscripting
```

## Usage

Here are a list of examples to learn about what this library can do.

### Hello, world!

```cpp
#include <cgilib.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  cgi::script s;
  s.content_type("text/plain");
  
  s.out << "Hello, world!";
  
  s.send_response();
  return 0;
}
```

### Redirection

```cpp
#include <cgilib.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  cgi::script s;
  s.redirect("/mydestination");
  return 0;
}
```

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://commsdevcpp.github.io/cgiscripting)_
